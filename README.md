# Database Systems Project
This is the repository for a database project of mine.
The scope of the project was to create a healthcare information system database.
The code in this repository is for one of the user types that would use the information system - a community healthcare worker.

This was my first time using php (aside from printing 'hello world' and getting data from a form using POST or GET). It was fun to make and I definitely learned from it. I have no doubt that there were **many** things I could have (and should have) done differently.
